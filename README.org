#+TITLE: Emacs Evil-Search-Highlight-Persist Minor Mode

This is a fork of the [[https://github.com/juanjux/evil-search-highlight-persist][original]] evil-search-highlight-persist. 

This Emacs extension will make =isearch= and =evil-ex-search-incremental= (the "slash
search") to highlight the search term (taken as a regexp) in all the buffer and
persistently until you make another search or clear the highlights with the
search-highlight-persist-remove-all command (default binding to =C-x SPC=). This
is how Vim search works by default when you enable hlsearch. This extension requires the 
"highlight" extension.

To enable:

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(require 'highlight)
(require 'evil-search-highlight-persist)
(global-evil-search-highlight-persist t)
#+END_SRC
